## My process

I started by reviewing both the instructions on the project's page, the README.md, and style-guide.md. I took time to familiarize myself with both the QR code component's design and functionality. After optimization and refactoring I was able to get the design to as close a resemblance to the design outlined in the README.md and styl-guide.md.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project helped reinfiorce both exisiting HMTL and CSS knowledge. I was not familiar with what a box-shadow was so I spent time rearching and implementing the right effect.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.09);
}
```

### Continued development

As I'm starting my journey into web development I definitely need to spend more time studying and building projects. I look forward to continued growth and development.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) - This helped me understand the box-shadow property and how best to implement it into my CSS.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFyMWwOxHYM) - Sankara Thomas provides an excellent project tutorial.
